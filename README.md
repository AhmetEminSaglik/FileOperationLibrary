# FileOperationLibrary
This is coded to use another project. Read&write file operation for txt. But the code within lack of some qualities is also designed to be able to improve.

<h2> Question About Testing :</h2>
How to test code? Should it be tested every function in every class or should it be tested after whole process? Most of the testing examples are about testing sum function of a calculater class. But mostly in project the functions alone maybe meaningless. After a few process they produce real things. So how to test exactly? If anyone helps I would be appreciate.
